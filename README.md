## About

The Croydon Creatives are a bunch of web folk who meet up on a monthly basis to have a chat, a drink and some food. It's a chance to get away from the screen and socialise with other like-minded individuals. Everyone is welcome.

It's hosted in a pub in Croydon (locations may vary), which is in South London, UK and is a 10-15 minute train ride from Central London.

## So What's All This Code?

By design, we're all a bunch of creative folk, and we all have specialities in different areas.  It makes sense to make the website a collaborative effort so everyone can jump in with their expertise and make it a better place for all.

Feel free to dive in and amend as you see fit! Shout [@CrCreatives](http://twitter.com/crcreatives "CroydonCreatives on Twitter") with your ideas!
